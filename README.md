# Bidirectional-Astar
It is an extension of the A* algorithm that aims to improve the efficiency of finding the shortest path between a start node and a goal node in a graph. It employs two simultaneous searches, one starting from the start node and the other starting from the goal node, with the goal of meeting in the middle and minimizing the search space.
